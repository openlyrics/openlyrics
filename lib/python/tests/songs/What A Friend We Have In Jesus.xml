    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>
        What a friend we have in Jesus, All ours sins and griefs to bear;<br/>
        What a privilege to carry, Everything to God in prayer!<br/>
        O what peace we often forfeit, O what needless pain we bear;<br/>
        All because we do not carry, Everything to God in prayer!
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>
        Have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere?<br/>
        We should never be discouraged, Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
        Can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows share?<br/>
        Jesus knows our every weakness; Take it to the Lord in prayer.
      </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>
        Are we weak and heavy laden, Cumbered with a load of care?<br/>
        Precious Saviour still our refuge; Take it to the Lord in prayer.<br/>
        Do thy friends despise forsake thee? Take it to the Lord in prayer!<br/>
        In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee; Thou wilt find a solace there.
